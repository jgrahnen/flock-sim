--------

* Originally due to SoftSurfer (http://geomalgorithms.com/).

* Fiddled with the include statements: they follow the old ".h" notation
  instead of "<>" notation.

* Also unfucked the old-style #endif pre-processor directives (no need for
  a label anymore).

* Had to fix a number of include issues: using std::istream and so on
  (program assume 'using namespace std'), poorly placed class declarations
  (other classes that just need a type should come early), and inclusion
  of math.h (dude just plain forgot that).

  Adding "using namspace std" to the test programs really helped, too...
